Organizational Amnesia
======================

<a name="citations-backlink"></a>
I've recently seen [a few articles](#citations-footnote) spring up on hacker news around the problem of organizational knowledge retention. I thought I'd take the opportunity to summarize some of the better insights from the comments and add my 2Â¢.

There are multiple problems we need to tackle for proper retention 
of organizational information:

* Recognizing that knowledge is salient.
* Motivating actors to store that knowledge.
* Finding that knowledge when it becomes crucial.

Depending on the size and health of your organization, you may be struggling
with different pieces of this pipeline. A ten-person startup is probably happy with tribal knowledge sharing until they experience their first bus
ticket event. An employee leaves, and suddenly the knowledge of their specialized
function is gone. 

A large and aged organization will have more problems with finding
useful information as well as recognizing that the information they need exists and can be found. Ignorance of available and useful knowledge results from the sheer amount of information the organization produces. If the information is not tightly curated, it can quickly become out of date, causing the noise to signal ratio to grow.

The middle organization seems to have it worst of all, experiencing a mix of all three issues. A middle-sized organization might not have given up on tribal knowledge entirely while feeling like they lack the capacity to invest in adequately curating their knowledge base. 

The worst practice I've seen is when organizations encourage

[blogging*](#irony-footnote) as documentation. Blogs are not always findable; blogs are saturated with key words making searching the knowledge
base difficult; blogs by nature are patchwork. A blog entry lacks the context to fully understand what problem the writer was addressing and why they got the results they did. A lesser criticism is that blogging leads developers with a more junior attitude to focus on including dank memes rather than focusing on clear communication. 

#### Community insight on the problem

It starts with those in leadership. You have to value insight.

Sometimes people don't know what to share or actively seek to hide information.

People are often short-sighted and fall into the trap of tribal knowledge.

Documentation rots and even fresh docs can have omissions.

If the information exists but is hard to find, it doesn't exist. It won't be 
found, and it won't be updated.

There is no signal that documentation is falling out of date.

### Solution Space

Techniques and tools I've found are actually useful for managing institutional knowledge. To understand why these tools are 
valuable, we need a working definition of what constitutes good documentation.

##### Good documentation answers the critical and least often asked questions in your organization.

The least often asked questions are the ones with the most likely to be forgotten answers. When this knowledge leaves the organization, it can be very costly to regain it.

##### Good documentation answers the most often asked questions in your organization.

As the number of times a question is asked increases the wasteful cost on other employees and, by proxy, the organization increases. If the answer is well documented, the cost is only born by the person asking the question.

##### Good documentation is close to the questions it answers.

Examples:
* In software development, the best documentation is inline comments and self-documenting code. 
  Followed by method comments, class or file comments, and finally (my favourite) package README files.
* In a software UX context, you might think of those little question mark icons (?) that describe the meaning and purpose of a form field or button.
* In hospitals, every patient's chart is hanging off their bed.
* Your favourite / most used files are (probably) cluttering up your desktop.
* Emergency procedures checklists in airplanes are immediately adjacent to the co-pilot.

For each case above, when a question is asked, the document answering that question is immediately available in the environment.

##### Good documentation is consistent

Documentation is only useful if it describes the true state of the world and how the world came to be. Wrong documentation may be an annoyance or a significant hindrance. In the latter case, incorrect documentation is worse than no documentation.

However, it is not enough to have documentation be consistent with the system,
it must also be consistent with other documentation.

##### Good documentation is searchable

We're all conditioned to use google. It's too late to fight that reality.

### Leveraging your "weakest" employees
One of the reasons documentation and the bus ticket problem are so salient in the software industry is that we have a high turnover rate. Estimates for retention periods vary but tend to be around 2 years, with less than ten percent of your workforce having
been around for more than 4-5 years. You have a lot of people leaving
and a lot of new hires joining your organization. 

It is essential for management to actively encourage and praise the writing and maintenance of clear, well-curated documentation.
When a new person joins your organization, they won't feel immediately comfortable merging code into a complex system. They must first learn the system, tripping over all the [WTFs](https://i2.wp.com/commadot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wtf.png?w=550)
in that system as they go. Let's not lie to ourselves; that number is much higher than zero. So let's use their inexperience to detect and fill holes in the documentation.

Among the more common documents I keep in my professionally groomed repositories is favorite-WTFs.md. This file describes problems and roadblocks that new devs should be made aware of and how to work around them. Sometimes this describes trade-offs we see as the choice of lesser evil or that my local team has virtually no power to fix.

When a new dev starts, make it clear their first *X* pull requests should be documenting
the history, reasons for, and considered alternatives of confusing parts of the code and architecture.
Help them polish the documentation and integrate it into the information architecture that they still aren't familiar with and then publicly acknowledge the contribution. 
NOTE: pair with them, don't just say to do a thing, that thing is probably ambiguous. 
Keep this up as they submit pull requests with code & documentation enhancements.

This constant reinforcement nurtures a culture where good documentation practices are valued. 
It is just as important how you address "bad" documentation. 
The developer did a good thing by creating **any** documentation. 
Recognize that. Tell them that. Positively reinforce the action you want to them to repeat, then help them raise it to the level that meets your standards.

If you're a new employee keep notes on the questions, you ask (including the ones only spoken in your head)
AND where you go looking for answers and how quickly you found those answers or if you had to involve a new person. 
Once you're a few months in, you will realize some of your searches were inefficient because 
"Of course I should have thought to look here instead. That's where we keep all the things." 
 Now you are in the best position to notice where intuition takes people in search of answers.
Even if you think the answer should not be moved, it may be appropriate to add a link to the answer where ever your intuition is likely to lead the next person joining the team.

#### Wikis
Organizations inevitably have a wiki. I consider this a bit of an anti-pattern
in software organizations because a wiki doesn't preserve locality. If the information isn't local, someone needs to find it. If someone needs to find it, they have to know how to look for it. Searching the wiki is pretty hit and miss.

As a software developer, I have yet to find a wiki tool better than markdown, source comments, and git. I'll give a few props to media-wiki which is markdown-esque
and is massively better than the many unnamed wikis that only permit WYSIWYG editing.
I've never met a WYSIWYG text editor that wasn't more pain than it was worth. Not once.

Wikis are good outside software mostly because non-technical people have experienced using them.
So here's a hit list of features your wiki should have:
* Renders standard markdown and HTML. 
* Webhook or similar notification when pages change.
* History, keep every revision of a page for the last N months.
* Accepts markdown page edits by API

These features go a long way, allowing third-party integrations. For example, you can efficiently integrate your organization-wide search implementation or just replace the wikis if you decide it's below par. Not all the features you want in a wiki need should be baked into the product. Search can be completely independent, as is the case for Wikipedia and Stackoverflow. Both products "have search" yet
their real search engine is google. 

One last side tactic for source control users that applies to wikis. 
If you're doing a good job of documenting your application in your repository, you can automatically publish your markdown files to the wiki as part of your CI pipeline. Thus your documentation lives where it is should and is still findable by non-technical members of your organization. Push-to-wiki is especially valuable for operational runbooks that should live close to the alarm definitions while also being accessible to any operator.

### Backlinking

There are a few ways you can try and solve backlinking. The simplest is to 
make a habit that when you add a link to document *A* pointing at document *B*
you also add a link on document *B* pointing to document *A*. These bidirectional links also happen to be the best approach because the backlink is contextualized.

However, this is a hard behaviour to motivate in people, and thankfully, unnecessary. A great technical solution is to provide a third party indexer. In high-level terms, we want to answer the question
"what other documents link to this document" or even more generally 
"what information is related to this information."  Since most of our documents live online in some form, we can crawl the organization's intranet and collect these. Your internal search probably does this already having copied the original page-rank algorithm from the early days of google. With the data already in hand, we need only expose the source of our links. 

We can further enhance this information by adding an analytics tool on top of our first-order index. Providing a browser plugin to employees that tracks link traversal and time spent reading specific documents can help us identify dead documents and documents that are ranked too high according to search. Note that some employees have 1984 levels of discomfort with this type of tracking, so please be a good citizen and don't log which users are doing a thing.

The browser plugin can provide a search option directly in the browser, as well as suggest documents that might relate to whatever your user is currently viewing.

Better still, your index can be used in the CI pipeline to ensure cross-linking between tools do not become broken. Honestly! Why do more wikis not automatically detect broken links when they point at other documents IN THE SAME WIKI </rage>. 

##### Executable documentation doesnt rot.

Coding practices I don't see often enough include Test-first development. 
A well-written test tells you something about the SUT (system under test). Better still, the "documentation" is now executable. It is self-verifying and, therefore, less likely to fall out of date. This is only one reason leaders should insist on writing tests first.

Markdown provides a code snippet syntax:
```markdown
 |```bash
 |echo hello
 |```
```
A simple parsing tool can strip away all the explanations leaving only the source code, which can then be executed as part of the CI loop. If your documentation is talking about an application instead of source code, then consider image recognition based user interface tests. Be warned such tests are often a bit prone to false negatives (i.e. failing because a web page was slow to load). While such tools won't stop you 
from making causing the documentation to fall out-of-date. They will provide a signal to fix it. The rest is on you.

##### NPxComplete's first law of documentation

Any process or knowledge that is not actively enforced, or at least enabled, by your CI/CD or Incident Management automation will be out-dated, ignored, or forgotten.
